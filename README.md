# 🐱 Cat Craft

A  Java program that lets users choose between three different cats to perform their unique night time action. Built to demonstrate fundamental object-oriented programming concepts like classes, objects, and methods, using a simple console interface.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧱 Object-Oriented Structure  
Each cat is represented as its own object from the `Cat` class, showing off basic Java OOP principles like class definitions and method calls.

### 🎮 Interactive Console Menu  
Prompts the user to:
- Name three cats
- Choose a cat (`1`, `2`, or `3`)
- See a unique message/action for each cat

### 📦 Error Handling  
Handles unexpected inputs (like picking a cat that doesn't exist) with a friendly error message.

### 🎯 Clean Switch Statement  
Uses a `switch` structure for streamlined logic. Can be configured to use classic case syntax or Java 14+ arrow (`->`) syntax depending on your setup.
